      <title>Space - scale resolved surface-atmospheric fluxes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Earth’s surface is heterogeneous at multiple scales owing to spatial variability in various properties. The atmospheric responses to these heterogeneities through fluxes of energy, water, carbon and other scalars are scale-dependent and non-linear. Although these exchanges can be measured using the eddy covariance technique, widely used tower-based measurement approaches suffer from spectral losses in lower frequencies when using typical averaging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, spatially resolved measurements such as airborne eddy covariance measurements can detect such larger scale &lt;code&gt;(meso-$\beta$, meso-$\gamma$)&lt;/code&gt; transport. To evaluate the prevalence and magnitude of these flux contributions  we applied wavelet analysis to airborne flux measurements over a heterogeneous mid-latitude forested landscape, interspersed with open water bodies and wetlands. The measurements were made during the Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors (CHEESEHEAD19) intensive field campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask, how do spatial scales of surface-atmosphere fluxes vary over heterogeneous surfaces across the day and across seasons?  Measured fluxes were separated into smaller-scale turbulent and larger-scale mesoscale contributions. We found significant mesoscale contributions to sensible and latent heat fluxes through summer to autumn which wouldn’t be resolved in single point tower measurements through traditional time-domain half-hourly Reynolds decomposition. We report scale-resolved flux transitions associated with seasonal and diurnal changes of the heterogeneous study domain. This study adds to our understanding of surface-atmospheric interactions over unstructured heterogeneities and can help inform multi-scale model-data integration of weather and climate models at a sub-grid scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observational work: working on space-scale mapping of surface fluxes using airborne measurements. Wavelet analysis of flux measurements to diagnose and quantify scale transport. Flux footprint analysis to investigate contributions from surface features over the seasons.  from the experiment:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~sws05agt/incompass_limitless/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;INCOMPASS&lt;/a&gt; was an intensive field experiment conducted in 2016 across the Indian subcontinent. The campaign was jointly funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) in the United Kingdom and Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) in India under the Drivers of Variability in the South Asian Monsoon programme. The experiment had an airborne and ground based observational campaigns, chiefly consisting of research flights on the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement (FAAM) Atmospheric Research Aircraft and an array of surface-flux towers (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3633&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Turner, AG, Bhat, GS, Martin, GM, et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface flux tower network was designed to collect high-frequency and high quality surface flux data that could inform the joint Indo-UK land-atmosphere interactions modeling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working as a Project Scientist with &lt;a href=&#34;https://caos.iisc.ac.in/faculty/bhat.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. G. S. Bhat&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://caos.iisc.ac.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, Indian Institute of Science&lt;/a&gt; I was responsible for the installation and maintanence of the relevant instruments at four of the field sites (Jaisalmer, Ahmadabad, Patna, Bangalore) spanning different climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruments and software handled :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSAT-3 Sonic Anemometers and EC-150 Open path CO2, H20 gas analyzer from Campbell Scientifc to measure insitu surface fluxes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming the CR-1000 dataloggers using CRBasic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flux calculations were performed using Eddy Pro. as detailed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3688&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bhat, GS, Morrison, R, Taylor, CM, et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thies Clima laser precipitation monitors to measure precipitation intensity and droplet size spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kipp and Zonen net radiometers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
